#  My VM Host Web Page

A simple **Node.js** web server that hosts my personal web page. The application utilises Node’s built-in HTTP module to serve an HTML page that describes my career, artistic background, and collaborations.

##  What the Application Does

This application starts a lightweight HTTP server that listens on **port 8000**.  
When a user accesses the server via a web browser, it responds with a styled HTML page containing:

- my personal profile  
- Links to my portfolio and creative projects  
- A detailed biography and list of artistic collaborations  
- Inline CSS for visual styling  
- A small JavaScript snippet for demonstration

In short, it’s a **self-hosted personal web page** generated dynamically from a Node.js server.

## Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime for building the server. |
| **HTTP Module** | Core Node.js module used to create and handle the web server. |
| **HTML5** | Defines the structure of the webpage served to the user. |
| **CSS3** | Provides styling for layout, typography, and colour. |
| **JavaScript** | Adds a simple console message to demonstrate client-side scripting. |

This project is intentionally minimal — no frameworks or external dependencies are used — to illustrate how a web server can be built **purely with native Node.js**.
